# docker-dllee-unified-yakkety

This builds a docker image for DL LEE Code. Repo [here](https://github.com/LArbys/dllee_unified).

Note, one needs the photon library to be in the same folder `docker build` is run from. This is because the last step will copy it into the image at the correct location.
